    <h1>Lord Shiva</h1>
    <pre>
    Param Pujya Dadashri described, “What people generally refer to as a Jyotirling is
     at a physical level. Further than that, there are subtle and even subtler levels. 
     Lastly, there is the subtle-most level of it - and that is the Self.”

Param Pujya Dadashri explained that the Self is an embodiment of Jyoti (divine light) 
and Prakash (divine illumination). The Self is genderless, and it is beyond the form of
 deha-linga (the form of the body). He further clarified that it is the qualities of the 
 Self - Gnan (Knowledge), Darshan (Vision), Charitra (Conduct), and Sukha (Bliss) – that 
 are represented in the form of a Jyotirling - the symbolic form of divine light of the 
 Soul, a Shivling

    <h2>Lotus Information</h2>
    <p>
        <pre>
            The lotus flower is an aquatic perennial. Sometimes mistaken for the water-lily,
            the lotus has a distinctively different structure. It also only comes in pink hu
            es or white, whereas the lily comes in many different colors. The roots are implanted
            in the soil of a river or pond, and the leaves float on the surface.

    <h3 id="h5">Chhota Bheem</h3>
    <h2>Chhota Bheem</h2>
     <p>
        <pre>
        The series is set in a village in the kingdom of Dholakpur. The series revolves around Bheem,
        sometimes referred to as Chhota Bheem due to his young age, a boy who is strong and intelligent.
        Bheem is a well-loved figure in the village, known for his good heart and helping nature.
